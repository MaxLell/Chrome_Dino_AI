# Dino_Ai
AI learns to play Google Chrome Dinosaur Game

Overview
============
This package contains two Versions of Google Chrome's famous Dino Game. One Version can be played by Humans (Run Human_Dino_Game.py). The other version trains and plays itself by Reinforcement Learning (Run Auto_Dino_Game.py). Its core algorithm is based on Neuro-Evolution Algorithms (Genetic Algorithms applied on Neural Networks).
(The Human version is operable, but still requires some polishing.)

Dependencies:
============
- numpy
- Pygame
