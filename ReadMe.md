# Dino_Ai

Overview
============

An AI-Bot is trained to automatically play the offline-google chrome dino game.
The Game was copied and redisigned in Pygame (Copyright Google). The Core Algorithm is based on Neuro-Evultion Algorithms (Genetic Algorithms applied on Neural Networks)

Dependencies:
============
- numpy
- Pygame

Instructions
============
Install both dependencies and run Auto_Dino_Game.py

Credits:
============
- Google for programming this awesome game
- This project was heavily inspired by the methods proposed by the book "The Nature of Code" by Shiffman (https://natureofcode.com/book/ - see chapter 9: Genetic Algorithms)  and his YouTube Series about applied Neuro-Evolution Algorithms (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Yd3975YwxrR0x40XGJ_KGO)
